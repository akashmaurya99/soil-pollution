    <h2> 1 :  What is Soil Pollution?</h2>

 <p>Soil Pollution is the process of degrading the land due to contamination or the presence of human waste. Soil contamination is a complicated issue. Everything from cigarette stubs, and littering to the overuse of chemical fertilizers contributes to the degradation of soil health. Industry, mining, military operations, garbage including technical waste and wastewater management, farming, stock breeding, and urban and transportation development are among the most prevalent causes of soil contamination. <br><br>
    Soil Pollution is a serious environmental concern as many problems that humans face are directly linked to it. Soil Pollution makes the soil less fertile which results in a lack of agricultural activities. Heavy metals present in the soil when reaches our body through food cause many diseases such as cancer and others. The image given below shows the scientist exploring the toxic land.

    <p>The root cause of soil pollution is often one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Agriculture (excessive/improper use of pesticides)</li>
        <li>Excessive industrial activity</li>
        <li>Poor management or inefficient disposal of waste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The challenges faced in soil remediation (decontamination of soil) are closely related to the extent of soil pollution. The greater the contamination, the greater the requirement for resources for remediation.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Domestic Sources of Pollution </h2>

    <p>Houses and commercial areas contain hundreds of thousands of chemicals. From pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), cleaning products, paints and solvents, flame-retardants, pesticides for in-house insects and gardening, the domestic environment is potentially exposed to a great variety of organic and inorganic contaminants. When discussing indoor pollution, consideration is given primarily to air pollution’s impact on human health, but rarely to the impact and the routes of entry into the soil and thus on the environment. However, even though the largest influx of contaminants into the soil from urban and commercial activities is through transport and waste, it is important to consider other entry routes.</p><br>
    <p>One of the major concerns for human health and the environment is the presence of lead in soils, which in urban areas is mostly associated with the use of lead-based paints and transport emissions. Due to its high biotoxicity, bioaccumulation and persistence, no safe level of exposure to lead has been determined (WHO, 2019a).</p><br>

    <p>Many developed countries banned the use of lead in fuel, paint and other products in the past century; for example lead in household paint was banned in Australia in 1920 (Needleman, 1998), while the United States of America banned it in 1978 (US EPA, 2013) and China in 1986 (Lin et al., 2009). Lead and its compounds are controlled in the European Union under the REACH regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals), which came into force in 2007 (EU, 2015). The Eurasian continent has the highest proportion of countries that have included binding values of lead in paints and fuel in their national legislation, although it remains uneven in the region (Figure 8), with significant gaps in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (UNEP, 2019d). The international community has joined forces to eliminate lead from all paints by 2020 through the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint headed by UN Environment and WHO (UNEP and WHO, 2011). According to their data, in 2019, 73 countries around the world already had a regulation on acceptable levels of lead in paint (UNEP, 2019d). Since 2009 IPEN, a member of the Global Alliance, has analysed more than 100 studies from 59 countries and found that lead paints are still widely sold in low- and middle-income countries. The studies comprised more than 3 300 solvent-based paints. Many of these paints contained very high levels of lead above 10 000 parts per million (ppm) of the dry weight of the paint. The results can be seem on IPEN’s interactive map (IPEN, 2020).</p>

    <p>However, despite national and international regulations, old houses and even newly produced paints still have high concentrations of lead and are widely commercialized mainly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (Clark et al., 2006; IPEN, 2017; Lin et al., 2009; O’Connor et al., 2018). Lead from these sources ends up in yards and gardens as the paint ages or after being intentionally removed (Nezat, Hatch and Uecker, 2017; Shayler, McBride and Harrison, 2009), with the accumulation of lead in soils to levels exceeding the permitted values (Mielke et al., 2004; US EPA, 1996). Other sources of lead pollution in urban environments include lead piping and tanks in old domestic plumbing systems (Beattie et al., 1972), vehicle exhausts in countries that still allow the use of leaded fuels (see section 3.5.5), and deposition of airborne particles from lead emitting industries (see section 3.5.2). The elimination of lead from petrol in many countries has led to a reduction of 39 percent of blood lead levels worldwide (JECFA and World Health Organization, 2011).</p><br>
    <p>In natural areas, where hunting is practised, the presence of lead in soils released from the weathering of lead-containing ammunition is also a concern for human health and the environment (Duggan and Dhawan, 2007; ECHA, 2018).</p>
   

    <h2>3. Industrial Waste</h2>

            alt="Industrial Waste">

    <p>The discharge of industrial waste into soils can result in soil pollution. Some common soil pollutants that can be sourced from industrial waste are listed below.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chlorinated industrial solvents</li>
        <li>Dioxins are produced from the manufacture of pesticides and the incineration of waste.</li>
        <li>Plasticizers/dispersants</li>
        <li>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)</li>
    </ul>
<h2>How can Soil Pollution be Controlled?</h2>
<p>Several technologies have been developed to tackle soil remediation. Some important strategies followed for the decontamination of polluted soil are listed below.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Excavation and subsequent transportation of polluted soils to remote, uninhabited locations.</li>
    <li>Extraction of pollutants via thermal remediation – the temperature is raised in order to force the contaminants into the vapour phase, after which they can be collected through vapour extraction.</li>
    <li>Bioremediation or phytoremediation involves the use of microorganisms and plants for the decontamination of soil.</li>
    <li>Mycoremediation involves the use of fungi for the accumulation of heavy metal contaminants.</li>
</ul>
